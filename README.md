## Sentiment Analysis
This research embarks on an enthralling exploration of sentiment analysis in the realm of e-commerce. In this research, I have used an explainable AI approach to train a Machine Learning Model to give predictions to identify public sentiments towards the different shoe brands. For this research, I have created my dataset by web scrapping and taking actual data from different e-commerce sites for the comaparison.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this research was to analyze customer sentiment towards different shoe brands using data collected from multiple e-commerce platforms. By creating a custom dataset through web scraping, I was able to gather real-world data to train and evaluate the machine learning model effectively. The insights derived from this analysis provide valuable information for businesses to understand consumer preferences and improve their products and services.

Data is collected through web scrapping and then incorporated Explainable AI methods to analyse the sentiment of customers towards different brands and their products.
